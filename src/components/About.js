                            The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by 
                            the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. <br/> It is a zero-player game, 
                            meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring 
                            no further input. <br/> One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial 
                            configuration and observing how it evolves.
